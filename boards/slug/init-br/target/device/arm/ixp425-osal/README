You need to download some files from Intel into $BUILDROOT/dl in order
for the nslu2's network port to work.  They can't be put in our
repository because they're under an incompatible license.

The required files are:

 1) BSD_ixp400AccessLibrary-2_1.zip
 2) IPL_ixp400NpeLibrary-2_1.zip

Instructions for downloading:
 1) Go to:
 http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/download_ixp400.htm

 2) Click the "Archived" link next to "Intel(R) IXP400 Software and
    Redboot* Boot Loader".
 3) Download the "Intel Hardware Access Software" version 2.1, and the
    "NPE Microcode" version 2.1.  No encryption.
    One has to login at some point in order to get these.
 4) Put those files in the download directory.
