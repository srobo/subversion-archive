\section {Game 3}

\subsection {Brief Description}

The objective of this game is to obtain the most points by taking designated tokens to a variety of zones. Placing tokens into a zone is worth a different quantity of points depending on the score weighting of each zone.

\subsection {Details}

\begin {itemize}

\item There will be 8 zones in the arena.
\item 20 tokens will be placed in the arena prior to gameplay.
\item Teams have a designated token colour and should collect those to obtain points.
\item Zones will have a different score weighting which means that placing a token in one zone will not be worth the same as placing tokens in another. The weightings of the zones will be defined prior to gameplay.
\item The game can involve forcing other teams to score low points by depositing thier tokens. 

\end {itemize}

\subsection {Rules}
