\section {Regulations}
\label{regs}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Robots must fit within a cube with 500mm sides.
\item Robots must have a switch which enables/disables the power to the motors.  This switch must be accessible from the outside of the robot.
\item No remote control systems may be used, with the exception of the Student Robotics radio system for starting and stopping matches.
\item This is a non-contact sport (accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable).
\item Robots should not intentionally damage tokens, zones, the arena or other robots.

\item Robots must have a flagpole attached.  The flagpole must be vertically mounted on the robot and 1m tall (when mounted on the robot and measured from the ground).  The flagpole is the only part of the robot that may exceed the 500mm height limit.  See section~\ref{sec:flags} for more details.

\item Robots must be entirely black along their sides and top surface.  This is to aid the vision system.

\item Student Robotics reserves the right to look at your robot software and hardware at any time.
\item All kit deployed by Student Robotics remains the property of Student Robotics.
\item The Judge's decision is final.
\end{enumerate}
