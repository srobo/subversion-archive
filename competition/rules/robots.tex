\label{robots}

\subsection {General}
\label{genrob}

\begin {description}
\item [\ref{genrob}.1] Robots must not exceed the dimensions 300mm x 400mm and 500mm height. The basis of these dimensions is defined by the starting orientation of the robot.
\item [\ref{genrob}.2] Robots must not contain offensive components, deliberately designed to degrade the performance of other teams.
\item [\ref{genrob}.3] Robots must not contain projectiles.
\item [\ref{genrob}.4] Robots must be completely autonomous.
\end {description}


\subsection {Required Components}

The robots must contain the following components:

\begin {itemize}
\item {Safety Cut-off switch.}
\item {Motors with selected gear ratio.}
\item {Rechargeable Battery.}
\end {itemize}

\subsection {Design Specifications}
\label {design}

\begin {itemize}
\item [\ref{design}.1] All internal mechanics and electronics must be easily accessible and examinable upon request.
\item [\ref{design}.2] All teams should ensure that components do not interfere with any of the provided safety systems. This includes the radio safety circuitry and the safety motor cut-off switch.
\item [\ref{design}.3] Robots must be powered by the individual 12V rechargeable battery provided by Student Robotics. The only other battery permitted in the robot is the button cell battery on the on board computer which should not be tampered with.
\end {itemize}
