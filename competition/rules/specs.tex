\subsection{Arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor is an $8m \times 8m$ square.
 The tolerance of the two arena dimensions is $\pm0.25m$.
\item The floor of the arena is made of white plastic coated hardboard.
 White Gaffer tape will be in place over the joints between hardboard sheets.
\item The arena walls are $600\pm30mm$ high and are made of the same material as the arena floor.
\item The arena is encased in a scaffolding structure, which is $1.4m \pm0.1m$ tall.	\textbf{@check}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Ramp}
\label{ramp}
\begin {enumerate} 
\item The ramp has the dimensions and shape shown in figure~\ref{fig:ramp-dim}.
\item The ramp will be located in the centre of the arena, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ramp-pos}.
\item The ramp has a footprint of $2m \times 1m$.
\item All vertical surfaces of the ramp are painted green, except for the inner faces of the safety barrier.  All other surfaces are painted white.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{tokens}
\begin {enumerate} 
\item Tokens are cubes of side $45\pm5mm$.
 Each team's kit contains a small number of these.
\item Tokens weigh $40\pm10g$.
\item A token can be either red or blue.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Robot Flags}
\label{sec:flags}
All robots must have a flagpole so that two flags can be mounted upon it:
\begin{description}
\item[Team Flag] The team flag is to be designed and created by the team.
 The team flag allows the robot to be easily identified.
 This flag must be mounted between $700mm$ and $900mm$ off the ground.
 It must not extend more than $200mm$ from the flagpole.

The team flag must not sag below $700mm$ above the ground.
\item[Match Flag] The match flag is to be supplied by Student Robotics at the start of every match.
 The match flag will slot over the top $100mm$ of the flagpole.
 The top $100mm$ of the flagpole must have an external diameter of $5\pm1mm$ so that the match flag can slot over it.
 The match flags have an end-cap so that they will not slide down the flagpole.
\end{description}

The flagpole must be removable so that the robot can be placed within a box to check the size limit.
A diagram of the flagpole arrangement can be found in figure~\ref{fig:flag}.
