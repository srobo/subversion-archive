<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>I've found a bug.  What should I do?</h2>
<p>
We work hard to make sure that our hardware and software is bug-free,
but some still manage to make their way through the cracks in our
procedure.  Discuss the problem you're having with the kit on our
forums.  We should be able to fix the bug and ship an update through
RoboIDE within two or three days.  Sometimes this will take longer.
The closer to the competition you find the bug, the less likely we are
to ship a fix, so make sure you tell us about bugs <strong>early</strong>.
