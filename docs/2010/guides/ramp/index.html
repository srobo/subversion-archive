<h1>How to build a ramp</h1>
<p>
These instructions are designed to teach you how to build the first section of the ramp which has one incline and also the trap door.
It is not necessary to build the whole ramp to test your robot(s).
These instructions are here as a guide.
They can be adapted to incorporate different building techniques.
</p>
<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>Six 500mm lengths of thick, wooden baton (60mm x 40mm or similar).</li>
 <li>Two 30mm lengths of thick, wooden baton (60mm x 40mm or similar).</li>
 <li>One 540mm lengths of 10mm diameter threaded bar or dowel.</li>
 <li>Two plywood right angled triangles of opposite and adjacent lengths 1000mm and 300mm.</li>
 <li>Three plywood rectangles 500mm x 300mm.</li>
 <li>One plywood rectangle 1044mm x 500mm.</li>
 <li>Nine 30mm lengths of aluminium L section with two screw holes cut into each side of the L so it can be mounted using screws/ bolts.
 <li>One plywood L shape  (all measurements in mm):</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>
Glue and screw three of the batons to one of the triangles as shown (use at least two screws per baton).
Notice that you will need to drill a hole in the centre of the vertical baton that is a little larger than 10mm in diameter, 65mm in from the end.
The top of the hole must be 10mm from the top of the triangle (this means you will have to shave off a corner of the baton so the road will lie flat.
</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>
Glue and screw the remaining three batons to one of the 500mm x 300mm rectangles as shown.
Again, you will need to drill a hole in the centre of the vertical baton that is a little larger than 10mm in diameter, 65mm in from the end.
The top of the hole in the vertical baton must be 10mm from the top:
 (not to scale)
</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Glue and screw the other triangle and a second 500mm x 300mm rectangle to the other side to complete the framework.
</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Screw two lengths of aluminium L section to each of the plywood pieces in the assembly in such a way that a roadway could be bolted to them.
One has been done below as an example (this should use up eight of the nine pieces).
</p>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>Screw remaining piece of L section to the baton at the top of the triangular section as shown:
</p>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>Screw down the 1044mm x 500mm piece of rectangular plywood onto the triangular section to create the road way for it and also screw down the L shaped piece of plywood to the rectangular section, linking it to the triangular section by screwing the L to the piece of L section screwed on in Step 5.
Your ramp should now look like this:

All that remains is to build the flap for the trap door.
</p>

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>Take the two 30 mm lengths of baton and one hole, just over 10mm in diameter, in each, 10mm from one of the faces.
</p>

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>
Take the final 500mm x 300mm piece of plywood and secure to the back the drilled blocks (again by using glue and screws but being careful not to screw into the holes) as shown:
</p>

<p>
These blocks should be placed such that the following diagrams criteria are met:
</p>

<p>
This can be attached to the ramp by running the threaded bar or dowel through all the holes thus creating the hinge mechanism.
</p>

<p>
You should now have a ramp that you can use to teach your robot the first part of the ramp.
Should you wish to build the whole ramp, use the building techniques listed above and the measurements given in the rules document to build the ‘second tier’.
</p>

<h2>Points to consider:</h2>
<p>
The competition ramp has a 50mm safety rail around the top to ensure your robot doesn’t fall off (except into the trap door!).
This can be simply created by extending the size of triangles and side pieces of the cuboid and securing the aluminium L section pieces lower down as shown below:
</p>

<p>
Another point to consider is that you may have noticed the trap door won’t lie completely flat due to the hinge mechanism.
The competition flap has been built as a wedge so that if something of height 270mm is pushed under the trap completely, it will lie flat.
To create the wedge, glue and screw a baton towards the bottom of the flap (i.e.
away from the hinge) and glue a piece of plywood to this that then sits at an angle as shown below:
</p>

<p>
Shaving down a corner of the baton will ensure a large enough surface area for the glue to adhere to.
One final point is that the competition trap door has a safety rail incorporated into it as shown below:
