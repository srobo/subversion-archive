<center><h1>Student Robotics Vision system</h1></center>
The electronics kit your team recieved at kickstart contains a webcam - when mounted on your robot and plugged into your USB hub and slug, you can use the webcam to make your robot aware of it's surroundings in the arena, and to find & collect coloured blocks.

To illustrate this, the picture to the right shows the inside of the (1/4 size) demonstration arena present at kickstart - you'll notice that most of the image is white, with red and blue blocks arranged on the floor, and to the far right a portion of black tape, outlining where the ramp would be.
