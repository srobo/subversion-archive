<h1>Student Robotics Vision system</h1>
The electronics kit your team recieved at kickstart contains a webcam - when mounted on your robot and plugged into your USB hub and slug, you can use the webcam to make your robot aware of it's surroundings in the arena, and to find & collect the coloured blocks.
