\section{Assembling the JointIO board}
The JointIO board provides analogue and digital Input/Output capabilities to your robot. Ensure that you have {\bf turned your robot OFF before continuing}

\subsection{RJ11 Cable}
Use one of your RJ11 cables to connect the Power Board (you may use any one of the four RJ11 sockets) to the JointIO Board.

The JointIO Board draws its power from the RJ11 connection, therefore it does not need an additional power supply.

\subsection{IO Devices}
Refer to the JointIO Board Documentation in order to connect your robot's IO devices to this board.

\subsection{Testing}
At this point you can write a simple python script to echo the value of its inputs at its outputs or to flash its outputs in a simple sequence. This will test that the board has been correctly installed. See the Programming Reference for more information.
