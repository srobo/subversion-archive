\section{Assembling the Motor Board}
We will now connect the Motor Board to the rest of the kit. Ensure that you have {\bf turned your robot OFF before continuing}

\subsection{RJ11 Cable}
Use one of your RJ11 cables to connect the Power Board (you may use any one of the four RJ11 sockets) to the Motor Board.

\subsection{Motor Power}
Use the wire and SR Connectors to connect the Motor power supply on the Power Board to the socket on the Motor Board. Ensure that the +12V signal at the Power Board is connected to +12V signal at the Motor Board, and also that GND connects to GND. {\bf You will need to refer to the Motor and Power Board Outlines!}

\subsection{Motors}
Now use more wire and SR Connectors to connect your robot's motors to the Motor Board. You will need to refer to the Motor Board Documentation.

\subsection{Testing}
At this point you can write a simple python script to test that the motors are correctly installed. See the Programming Reference for more information
