\section{Assembling the PWM board}
The PWM Board, sometimes referred to as the Servo Board, controls up to 6 Servos and also features an LCD display which can be used during testing. Ensure that you have {\bf turned your robot OFF before continuing}

\subsection{RJ11 Cable}
Use one of your RJ11 cables to connect the Power Board (you may use any one of the four RJ11 sockets) to the PWM Board.

\subsection{Servo Power}
Use the wire and SR Connectors to connect the Servo power supply on the Power Board to the socket on the PWM Board. Ensure that the +5V signal at the Power Board end is connected to +5V signal at the PWM Board end, and also that GND connects to GND. {\bf You will need to refer to the PWM and Power Board Outlines!}

\subsection{Servos}
Refer to the PWM Board Documentation in order to connect your robot's servos to this board.

\subsection{Testing}
At this point you can write a simple python script to test that the servos and LCD are correctly installed. See the Programming Reference for more information.
