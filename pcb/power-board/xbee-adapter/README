This is an adapter so that the Maxstream xBee radio module can be
plugged into a breadboard.  The xBee module has a 2mm pin pitch, and
so cannot be plugged into a breadboard (which is 2.5mm or 100 thou
pitch).

This adapter is fast and cheap.  It's single sided, so that there's
little effort required to make it.

Obviously this adapter is only required for prototyping purposes.

The brd, sch and lib files are EAGLE files.
