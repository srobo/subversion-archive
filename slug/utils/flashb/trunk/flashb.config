# What follows is a description of which I2C commands to use to flash
# each device.
# Each device has a section in this field starting with [DEVICENAME].
# Each of these sections must contain the following values:
#  * address: The address of the device in hex (can include '0x')
#  * top: The base address of the top memory section in hex
#  * bottom: The base address of the bottom memory section in hex
#  * cmd_fw_ver: Command to read firmware version
#  * cmd_fw_chunk: Command to send a chunk to the msp430
#  * cmd_fw_next: Command to read the next address that the msp430 expects  
#  * cmd_fw_crcr: Command to read the CRC of the firmware calculated on the MSP430
#  * cmd_fw_confirm: Command to confirm the firmware CRC
